            <h2 class="heading">What is SWOT Analysis?</h2>
            SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. A SWOT analysis is a framework to help
            assess and
            understand the internal and external forces that may create opportunities or risks for an organization.
            Strengths and weaknesses are internal factors. They are characteristics of a business that give it a
            relative advantage (or disadvantage, respectively) over its competition.
            Opportunities and threats, on the other hand, are external factors. Opportunities are elements of the
            external environment that management can seize upon to improve business performance (like revenue growth or
            improved margins).

            <h2 class="heading">Key Highlights</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>SWOT is used to help assess the internal and external factors that contribute to a company’s
                    relative advantages and
                    disadvantages.</li>
                <li>
                    A SWOT analysis is generally used in conjunction with other assessment frameworks, like PESTEL and
                    Porter’s 5-Forces.
                </li>

                    Findings from a SWOT analysis will help inform model assumptions for the analyst community.

        <div class="container">
            <h2 class="heading">Strengths</h2>
            <p>Strengths may be any number of areas or characteristics where a company excels and has a competitive
                advantage over its peers. Advantages may be more qualitative in nature and therefore difficult to
                measure (like a great corporate culture, strong brand recognition, proprietary technology, etc.), or
                they may be more quantitative (like best-in-class margins, above-average inventory turnover,
                category-leading return on equity, etc.).</p>

        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h2 class="heading">Weaknesses</h2>
            <p>Weaknesses are areas or characteristics where a business is at a competitive disadvantage relative to its
                peers. Like strengths, these can also be more qualitative or quantitative. Examples include
                inexperienced management, high employee turnover, low (or declining) margins, and high (or excessive)
                use of debt as a funding source.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h2 class="heading">Opportunities</h2>
            <p>The “Opportunities” section should highlight external factors that represent potential growth or
                improvement areas for a business. Consider opportunities like a growing total addressable market (TAM),
                technological advancements that might help improve efficiency, or changes in social norms that are
                creating new markets or new sub-segments of existing markets.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h2 class="heading">Threats</h2>
            <p>Threats are external forces that represent risks to a business and its ability to operate. The
                categories tend to be similar to the “Opportunities” section, but directionally opposite.
                Consider
                examples like an industry in decline (which is the same as a decreasing TAM), technological
                innovation that could disrupt the existing business and its operations, or evolving social norms
                that make existing product offerings less attractive to a growing number of consumers.</p>

            <h2 class="heading">How to Conduct a SWOT Analysis</h2>
            <p>A SWOT analysis is rarely completed in isolation; it generally makes up one part of a broader business
                analysis. And while it is itself an assessment framework, a SWOT analysis is also an effective tool to
                help summarize other findings.

                For example, an analyst can’t really assess a company’s strengths and weaknesses without first
                understanding the business and its industry. They may wish to leverage other tools and frameworks in
                order to accomplish this, including:</p>
            <ul><br>
                <li>Hax’s Delta Model – This will help to understand competitive positioning.</li>
                <li>This will help visualize the relative risk of a management team’s growth strategies.</li>
                <li>This will help identify trends (year-over-year), as well as a firm’s relative performance (using
                    benchmarking data).</li>
            </ul> <br>
            <p>The same is true for external factors – opportunities and threats. It’s nearly impossible to understand
                these without first considering:</p><br>
            <ul>
                <li>The industry life cycle – Does the business operate in a growing, mature, or declining industry?
                    This itself informs both opportunities and threats.</li>
                <li>An analysis of the broader business environment or the industry itself – Think frameworks like
                    PESTEL or Porter’s 5 Forces.</li>
            </ul>
